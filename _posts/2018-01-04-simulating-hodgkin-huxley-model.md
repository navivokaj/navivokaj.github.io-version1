title: "Simulating the Hodgkin-Huxley Model"

In my first post, I will be simulating the Hodgkin-Huxley Model using Python. The Hodgkin-Huxley model is given by

$$ C_m \dfrac{dV}{dt} = I_{ionic} + I_{stim} $$

$$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$

$$ \mathbf{X}\_{n,p} = \mathbf{A}\_{n,k} \mathbf{B}\_{k,p} $$

I am currently studying how to use MathJax so that equations will appear in this blog elegantly.
