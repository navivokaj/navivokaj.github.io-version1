title: "Ready, Integrate, Fire!’ Part 1: Solving a simple neuronal model"

For my first blog post, I will be finding the analytical solution of a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model of a neuron under a constant input current. Too much to handle? Read more to find out! (This is Part 1 of a series of four posts on LIF model)

My love for numbers has sparked my interest on how I can use mathematics to model the complex processes happening inside the human brain. So when I created this blog, I wanted to start with modelling just a single neuron—the building block of our brains. The model I chose to focus on comes in an intriguing (and somehow provocative!) name: leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model.

Why did I choose LIF model? It’s a simple model. That’s it. In my journey to becoming a computational neuroscientist, I have to start with understanding the basic models in the field of neuroscience. Despite its ‘simplicity’, I delved a lot into this model, and I even think that it deserves more spotlight that I decided to dedicate my first four blog posts on this single model! For my first blog post, I will be finding the analytical solution of a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model of a neuron under a static input current. Ready to know more? Let’s start!
